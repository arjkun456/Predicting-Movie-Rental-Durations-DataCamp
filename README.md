## ⚙️ How to Use
1. **Input Data**  
   Prepare your data in a simple format. You can use Excel or a CSV file. The data should include features like movie title, genre, rental price, and past rental durations.

2. **Choose a Model**  
   The application allows you to select from several prediction models. You can experiment with each to find which one gives the best results.

3. **Run Predictions**  
   Click the “Run” button to begin processing your data. The tool will compute the predictions and display them.

4. **Review Results**  
   The application shows the predictions along with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each model. Use this to assess which model performs best for your data.

## 📊 Understanding the Results
- **Predicted Durations**: Here, you will see the estimated rental durations based on your input data.
- **MSE Value**: This value helps you assess the accuracy of your predictions. A lower MSE indicates better predictive quality.

## 📝 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while running the software:

- **Check System Requirements**: Ensure your computer meets the minimum requirements.
- **Revisit Steps**: Go back and verify that you followed all installation steps correctly.
